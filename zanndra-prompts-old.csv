Data Map,Create Data Map Tracking People,"You are an expert in generating HTML code for visualizing security incident timelines. Your task is to create a complete HTML file that presents a security incident analysis in a clear, visually appealing, and structured format. The incident data will be provided to you in a structured format (see “Input Data Format” below).

Output Requirements:

HTML Structure: The output must be a complete, valid HTML5 document. Timeline Visualization: The core of the visualization is a timeline showing the sequence of events. Use a vertical line to represent the timeline. Timeline Items: Each event in the timeline should be represented as a distinct timeline item. Alternate the positioning of timeline items (left/right) for visual clarity. Message Bubbles: Each event should include a “message bubble” containing the text of the event. Alternate the background colors of the message bubbles between black and gray, representing different participants. Assume the first event is from the first participant in the data, and alternate from there. Icons: Include a Font Awesome icon at the beginning of each timeline item. Use the following icons based on the severity field in the input data: info: For severity of “Information” or “Normal”. Use the fas fa-info-circle icon. upload: For severity of “Suspicious”. Use the fas fa-upload icon. exclamation-triangle: For severity of “Critical”. Use the fas fa-exclamation-triangle icon. CSS Styling: Use inline CSS to style the elements. Include the following styles: A sans-serif font for the body. Styling for the timeline line, timeline items, dates, events, locations, message bubbles, and icons (colors, padding, border-radius). Font Awesome Integration: Include the Font Awesome 6.0.0 CDN link in the <head> section to ensure icons are displayed correctly. Data-Driven: The HTML should be generated based on the provided input data. It should be able to handle a variable number of timeline items. Accessibility: Include a <title> element with a descriptive title and a <desc> element describing the visualization. Input Data Format:

You will receive the incident data as a list of dictionaries (or JSON-like structure). Each dictionary will have the following keys:

date: (string) The date of the event (e.g., “Monday, Jan 1”). event: (string) A description of the event (e.g., “Initial planning discussion about ‘Proj Alpha.’”). location: (string) Location data associated with the event (e.g., “John: Seattle, Jane: Spokane”). severity: (string) The severity level of the event (“Information”, “Suspicious”, “Critical”). participant: (string) The name of the participant associated with the event (e.g. “John”, “Jane”). Example Input Data:
